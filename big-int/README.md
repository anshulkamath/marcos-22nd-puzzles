# Big Int Puzzle
We meet again, Mr. MacOS. It's been too long.
I hope you're intimidated by the abundance of files here... I think you have a feeling of what I'm going to ask.
If you remember back to the second semester of your junior year of college, your roommate was weirdly obsessed with this "big int" project.
I bet that you were so thankful that you would never have to deal with the problems that he had to deal with... the constant memory issues,
the testing infrastucture, having to program in C... what a nightmare!

Well, unfortunately I must be the bearer of bad news.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to implement add and subtract for both big integers and modular arithmetic.

You will test these functions with the command `make test`, and upon completion of said functions, you will be given your key phrase.
Good luck!
